# Llama Scout Model Analysis

## Model Information
- **Model**: meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct
- **Size**: 17B parameters (50 safetensors files)
- **Location**: `/home/ubuntu/mem0-assignment/mem0-backend/model_cache/models--meta-llama--Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct`

## Testing Results

### ‚ùå Benchmark Status: **FAILED**

### Memory Requirements
- **GPU Available**: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 (79.19 GiB total)
- **Memory Usage During Load**: ~77GB+ (exceeds available memory)
- **Quantization Tested**: 4-bit quantization with BitsAndBytesConfig
- **Result**: CUDA out of memory errors during model loading

### Error Details
```
CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.50 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 79.19 GiB 
of which 2.17 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 77.01 GiB memory in use.
```

## Analysis

### Why the Model Failed to Load
1. **Model Size**: 17B parameters is significantly larger than the 8B models we've been benchmarking
2. **Memory Overhead**: Even with 4-bit quantization, the model requires more than the 80GB available
3. **Loading Process**: The model uses ~77GB during the loading phase, leaving insufficient memory for completion

### Comparison with Working Models
- **Base Model (8B)**: ~6-8GB memory usage ‚úÖ
- **Fine-tuned Models (8B)**: ~4-8GB memory usage ‚úÖ  
- **Scout Model (17B)**: ~77GB+ memory usage ‚ùå

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Skip Scout Model Benchmarking
Given the memory constraints, the most practical approach is to:
- Focus on the 8B models that are working well
- Document this limitation in the final report
- Note that 17B models require specialized infrastructure

### Option 2: Alternative Approaches (Advanced)
If Scout model benchmarking is critical:
1. **Multi-GPU Setup**: Use model parallelism across multiple GPUs
2. **CPU Offloading**: Use extensive CPU offloading (very slow)
3. **Smaller Hardware**: Test on systems with larger GPU memory (A100 80GB clusters)
4. **Different Quantization**: Try 8-bit or even lower precision

### Option 3: Use Pre-converted GGUF Version
- Look for pre-converted GGUF versions of the Scout model
- GGUF models typically have much lower memory requirements
- Would require downloading from community conversions

## Conclusion

The Llama-4-Scout-17B model is **too large** for benchmarking on the current H100 80GB setup. The model requires more memory than available even with aggressive 4-bit quantization.

**Recommendation**: Continue with the successful 8B model benchmarks and document this as a known limitation.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete fine-tuned 8B model benchmarks  
2. ‚úÖ Generate comparison analyses for working models
3. üìù Document Scout model limitations in final report
4. üéØ Focus on actionable insights from 8B model comparisons
